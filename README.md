# Compiler for Rigi language
Future pet-project of Lokilife
<hr>
This is planned to be a compiler for programming language called Rigi,<br>
it'll have TypeScript-like syntax but better and without<br>
problems from JavaScript that have TypeScript... I hope it will not<br>
I wanna to add here better reflection, better type-safety and without<br>
silly implicit type conversions as in JavaScript.<br>
<hr>
Any way I doubt that this project will be alive for a long time,<br>
but let's give it a chance.
